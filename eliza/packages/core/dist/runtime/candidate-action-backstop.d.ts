/**
 * Candidate-action backstop registry — lets a host plugin declare which
 * candidate action names belong to it and how to recognize a message that is
 * genuinely addressed to those actions.
 *
 * The message pipeline's coding-delegation backstop consults these rules before
 * it strips candidate actions in favor of a coding-delegation action: when a
 * message reads as coding work but a registered rule both owns one of the
 * candidate actions AND matches the message text, the rule protects its
 * candidates from being overridden. When the backstop does force coding
 * delegation, every action owned by a registered rule is filtered out of the
 * candidate set.
 *
 * Cycle-avoidance: core defines the slot, plugins fill it. Core never imports
 * plugin-side symbols or hardcodes plugin-specific action names / heuristics.
 *
 * Registration uses a module-scoped WeakMap keyed by runtime instance so the
 * rule lifetime tracks the runtime and we don't leak across tests — same shape
 * as `SendPolicy` and `LocalizedExamplesProvider`.
