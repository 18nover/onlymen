# Threat Modeling

## Overview

Structured approach to identifying, categorizing, and mitigating security threats using STRIDE methodology, DREAD scoring, and attack trees.

## The OnlyMen threat model (apply before the generic method)

Our users are gay men, some in hostile jurisdictions or unsupportive
environments. **Outing is the primary harm model** — a data exposure that
would be low-severity for a generic social app can be life-altering here.
Rank findings accordingly.

High-sensitivity surfaces (all verified in the fork):
- **Membership itself**: an account on OnlyMen implies orientation.
  Anything that lets a third party test "does phone/email/handle X have an
  account" (enumeration, contact-match side channels, password-reset
  oracles) is a top-tier finding.
- **Contact matching** (`app.bsky.contact.*`): phone numbers + the social
  graph. Hash-based mutual matching only; `removeData` must genuinely
  purge; `getMatches` must never reveal one-sided imports. SMS
  verification creates carrier-visible metadata.
- **Age assurance** (`app.bsky.ageassurance.*`): the stash `#event`
  records carry email, IP, UA, country — identity-linkable verification
  trails. Retention and provider (KWS) data-sharing need explicit review.
- **Public-by-design repos**: posts, likes, follows, blocks are PUBLIC and
  federated — deletion is a request to the network, not a guarantee. UI
  must never imply repo data is private; private state belongs server-side
  (bsync/stash — see Morgan's `appview.md`).
- **Federation**: other AppViews/relays can index our users' public data;
  moderation (labels/takedowns) applies per-service, not globally.
- **Custodial keys**: our PDS holds users' signing keys — host compromise
  = account integrity compromise (see `identity.md`).

Standing rule: any feature that collects, links, or exposes user data gets
a Seth review gate before implementation (Andrew roadmap risk table).

### Application to Components

```yaml
threat_model:
  components:
    - name: "API Gateway"
      stride:
        spoofing:
          - threat: "Token replay attack"
            mitigations: ["Short-lived tokens", "Token binding"]

```

## DREAD Scoring

### Formula

```
DREAD Score = (D + R + E + A + D) / 5
```

| Factor              | Description                          | Scale (1-10)                    |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Damage Potential    | Impact if exploited                  | 1=Minimal, 10=Total compromise  |
| Reproducibility     | Ease of reproducing the exploit      | 1=Difficult, 10=Trivial         |
| Exploitability      | Skill/tools needed                   | 1=Expert, 10=Script kiddie      |
| Affected Users      | Number of users impacted             | 1=Few, 10=All users             |
| Discoverability     | Likelihood of discovering the flaw   | 1=Hidden, 10=Public/obvious     |

### Risk Thresholds

| Score Range | Risk Level  | Action Required                              |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 8.0 - 10.0  | Critical    | Fix immediately, block release               |
| 6.0 - 7.9   | High        | Fix within sprint                            |
| 4.0 - 5.9   | Medium      | Fix within current release cycle             |
| 2.0 - 3.9   | Low         | Schedule fix, document risk acceptance       |
| 1.0 - 1.9   | Informational | Note in security backlog                   |

### Scoring Example

```python
def dread_score(damage, reproducibility, exploitability, affected_users, discoverability):
    return (damage + reproducibility + exploitability + affected_users + discoverability) / 5

# Example: SQL injection in user profile endpoint
score = dread_score(
    damage=8,            # Can read all user data
    reproducibility=10,  # Trivially reproducible
    exploitability=7,    # Requires basic SQL knowledge
    affected_users=9,    # Affects all users
    discoverability=8    # Visible in API documentation
)
# DREAD = 8.4 → Critical
```

## Attack Trees

### Structure

```
                    [Goal: Steal User Data]
                           /          \
                    [OR]               [OR]
                   /    \             /    \
          [Compromise   [Exploit   [Social  [Physical
           API Server]   Client]   Engineer] Access]
              |              |         |          |
         [SQLi, SSRF]  [XSS, MITM] [Phish]  [Device Theft]
```

### Building Attack Trees

1. Define the root goal (what the attacker wants)
2. Identify sub-goals that achieve the root goal
3. For each sub-goal, identify methods
4. Annotate nodes with cost/likelihood
5. Identify the "cheapest path" to the goal

### Cost Analysis

```yaml
attack_tree:
  goal: "Access user messages"
  paths:
    - method: "SQL Injection via profile API"
      cost: "Low (script available)"
      likelihood: "Medium"
      skill: "Low"
    - method: "Steal session token via XSS"
      cost: "Low"
      likelihood: "Medium"
      skill: "Medium"
    - method: "Compromise push notification service"
      cost: "High (need internal access)"
      likelihood: "Low"
      skill: "High"
    - method: "Social engineering support staff"
      cost: "Medium"
      likelihood: "High"
      skill: "Low"
```

## Threat Modeling Process

```
1. Define Scope
   → What are we modeling?
   → What's in/out of scope?

2. Identify Assets
   → What are we protecting?
   → Classification level

3. Create Architecture Diagram
   → Components, data flows, trust boundaries

4. Identify Threats (STRIDE)
   → Per component, per data flow

5. Assess Risk (DREAD)
   → Score each threat
   → Prioritize by risk level

6. Define Mitigations
   → For each high-priority threat
   → Cost-benefit analysis

7. Validate
   → Verify mitigations are implemented
   → Penetration testing
   → Code review

8. Document & Iterate
   → Maintain threat model as living document
   → Update with each major change
```

|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| New feature or component        | Update threat model                   |
| Security incident               | Full review + re-score                |
| Quarterly                       | Review and refresh all threat models  |
| Dependency update               | Check for new threats                 |
| Architecture change             | Re-assess trust boundaries            |
