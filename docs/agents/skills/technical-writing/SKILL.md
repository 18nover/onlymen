### README Quality Standards

- The first line must be the service name as an H1
- Second line must be a one-sentence description (no more)
- Quick Start must get a new developer running the service in under 5 minutes
- All required environment variables must be documented
- Architecture section must include a diagram (ASCII or linked image)
- Every README must link to detailed docs, not inline them

---

## 2. API Documentation Standards

### Endpoint Documentation Template

The API surface here is **XRPC**, driven by lexicon schemas (see Lexi's
`lexicon-schema.md`) — Penelope documents the method in narrative form, but
the contract itself is the lexicon JSON, not a hand-written spec:

```markdown
### `com.atproto.repo.createRecord` (procedure)

Create a new record in the authenticated user's repo.

**Authentication**: Session or OAuth access token required.

**Input**:

| Field        | Type     | Required | Description                    |
|--------------|----------|----------|---------------------------------|
| `repo`       | string   | Yes      | DID of the repo (usually the caller's own) |
| `collection` | string   | Yes      | NSID of the record type, e.g. `app.bsky.feed.post` |
| `rkey`       | string   | No       | Explicit record key (auto-generated TID if omitted) |
| `record`     | object   | Yes      | The record itself, matching the collection's lexicon |

**Output**:

```json
{
  "uri": "at://did:plc:abc123/app.bsky.feed.post/3jwdwj2ctlk26",
  "cid": "bafyrei...",
  "commit": { "cid": "bafyrei...", "rev": "3jwdwj2ctlk26" }
}
```

**Errors** (from the lexicon's declared `errors`, not generic HTTP codes):

| Error                  | Description                              |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `InvalidSwapCommit`     | `swapCommit` didn't match current HEAD  |
| `InvalidSwapRecord`     | `swapRecord` didn't match existing value |
```

### API Documentation Rules

- Every method's contract is the lexicon (`atproto/lexicons/**/*.json`), not
  hand-written independently — document behavior and gotchas, don't restate
  the schema (that duplicates what `lex gen-md` already produces).
- All code examples must be copy-pasteable and tested against a real dev-env.
- NSIDs, not URL paths, are the addressing scheme (`com.atproto.repo.createRecord`,
  not `/api/v1/records`) — don't invent REST-style versioned paths.
- Errors documented match the lexicon's declared `errors` array exactly.
- Include a real request/response pair captured from a working call, not a
  fabricated example.

### Generated API Reference

Don't hand-maintain an OpenAPI spec — `atproto/packages/lex-cli`'s `lex
gen-md` generates a Markdown API reference directly from lexicon JSON,
regenerated via `pnpm codegen`. Penelope's job is the narrative doc layer on
top (guides, gotchas, migration notes), not re-deriving the contract by
hand — see `api-doc-standards.md` for the full pipeline.

- Action items must have owners and due dates
- Track post-mortem action items in the same backlog as engineering work
- Publish post-mortems to the entire engineering team

## 8. Writing for Different Audiences

### Audience Adaptation Guide

| Audience           | Style                              | Depth     | Jargon        |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|-----------|---------------|
| New developer      | Tutorial, step-by-step             | Detailed  | Define all    |
| Experienced dev    | Reference, concise                 | Moderate  | Use freely    |
| Product manager    | Outcome-focused, visual            | High-level| Avoid         |
| Operations/SRE     | Runbook, command-oriented          | Detailed  | Use freely    |
| External API user  | Example-driven, precise            | Moderate  | Define terms  |
| Executive          | Summary, impact, numbers only      | Minimal   | Avoid         |

### Writing Principles

1. **Lead with the answer**: Start with what the reader needs to know, then explain why
2. **One idea per paragraph**: Short paragraphs, clear transitions
3. **Use concrete examples**: Abstract descriptions lose readers
4. **Define terms on first use**: Don't assume prior knowledge
5. **Use active voice**: "The service processes the request" not "The request is processed by the service"
6. **Front-load important information**: Don't bury the key point in the third paragraph

### Jargon Glossary (OnlyMen)

| Term          | Definition                                            |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| NSID          | Namespaced identifier for a lexicon (`app.bsky.feed.post`) |
| Lexicon       | JSON schema defining a record or XRPC method's contract |
| AT-URI        | `at://did/collection/rkey` — addresses a specific record |
| DID           | Decentralized identifier — an account's permanent identity |
| PDS           | Personal Data Server — hosts a user's repo             |
| Lexi          | The lexicon/schema-design agent                         |
| Karen        | The moderation-tooling agent (Ozone, labels, reports)   |
| Devon       | The infrastructure agent (DevOps, deployment)           |
| Quinn       | The quality agent (testing, QA)                         |
| Penelope        | The documentation agent                                 |

## 9. Documentation Tooling

### Recommended Tools

| Purpose               | Tool              | Notes                                |
|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| API docs              | OpenAPI + Redocly | Auto-generate from spec              |
| Architecture diagrams | Mermaid           | Version-controlled in markdown       |
| Runbooks              | Markdown in repo  | Searchable, reviewable               |
| Release notes         | GitHub Releases   | Linked to changelog                  |
| Knowledge base        | Wiki or docs site | Searchable, categorized              |
| Diagramming           | Excalidraw        | For complex system diagrams          |

### Mermaid Diagram Example

```markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client] -->|HTTPS| B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[API Service]
    B --> D[Karen Service]
    C --> E[(PostgreSQL)]
    C --> F[(Redis)]
    D --> G[Edge Device]
    D --> H[Cloud Detection API]
    E --> I[Backup to S3]
```
```

### Documentation Linting

Use `markdownlint` to enforce consistency:

```json
{
  "default": true,
  "MD013": { "line_length": 120 },
  "MD024": { "siblings_only": true },
  "MD033": false,
  "MD041": false
}
```

## 10. Common Gotchas

- **Docs go stale**: If documentation isn't next to the code it describes, it will rot. Co-locate docs with source code.
- **Over-documenting**: Don't document obvious code. Focus on "why" and "gotchas", not "what".
- **Missing context**: A deployment guide that assumes the reader knows which server to SSH into is useless. Be explicit.
- **No examples**: API documentation without request/response examples is incomplete. Every endpoint needs a curl example.
- **Version drift**: Architecture docs and API specs must be version-controlled and updated with code changes.
- **Inconsistent formatting**: Enforce consistent markdown style with linting. Inconsistent docs look unprofessional.
- **Missing diagrams**: Complex systems are hard to understand from text alone. Include diagrams for architecture and data flow.
- **No ownership**: Every doc should have a listed owner. Ownerless docs become stale silently.

---

## 11. Quality Standards

- Every service must have a README that passes the "5-minute test" (new developer can run it in under 5 minutes)
- Every API endpoint must have complete documentation with examples
- Every architectural decision must have an ADR
- Every runbook must be testable by someone unfamiliar with the incident type
- Every release must have written release notes before deployment
- Every SEV1/SEV2 incident must have a post-mortem within 5 business days
- All documentation must pass markdownlint without errors
- Documentation must be reviewed in PRs with the same rigor as code
- Complex systems must have architecture diagrams (Mermaid preferred)
- Documentation must be accessible: proper heading hierarchy, alt text for images, descriptive link text
